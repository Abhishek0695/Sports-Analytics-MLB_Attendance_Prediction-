This project is focused on sports analytics. This data set is made available by http://www.baseball-reference.com/ It contains data about professional baseball (MLB) games played in the 2016 season. There are 2,427 games in the data set. Each row represents a single game. The goal is to predict the attendance at a home teamâ€™s game and check if attendace is greater than average attendace of previous season 2015. This is an important task because most franchises want to predict the number of attendees for a variety of reasons including profits. I have used models such as Support Vector Classifier, Stochastic Gradient Descent and Logistic Regression for this problem. Upon analysis, it was observed that Logistic Regression model performed the best with accuracy of 83%.
